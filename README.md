# Pokemon Quiz

Command line tool for myself (and probably only myself) to see if I can list all Pokemon in order, with various variations

During the pandemic, one of the (few) things I did was memorize the first ~800 Pokemon in order. I'm not into Pokemon anymore, but being able to list the first 800 Pokemon is such an impressive skill that I don't want to forget. No existing tool does exactly what I want. [Visit OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/) comes the closest, but everything has drawbacks. So I created the exact tool I wanted. Hooray

## Running the Program

To run the program, type `pokemon`

To set up the program to run from anywhere on your computer, type the following command: `cp pokemon ~/.local/bin`. If you update `pokemon`, you'll need to run the command `rm ~/.local/bin/pokemon && cp pokemon ~/.local/bin`
