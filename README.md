# Pokemon Quiz

Command line tool for myself (and probably only myself) to see if I can list all Pokemon in order, with various variations

During the pandemic, one of the (few) things I did was memorize the first 809 Pokemon in order (up to Pokemon Sun & Moon). I'm not into Pokemon anymore, but being able to list the first 809 Pokemon is such an impressive skill that I want to keep it. No existing tool does exactly what I want in an optimized fashion, so I made this simple CLI game for myself.

## Running the Program

To run the program, simply type `pokemon` from the root directory

To set up the program to run from anywhere on your computer, type the following command: `cp pokemon ~/.local/bin`. If you update `pokemon`, you'll need to run the command `rm ~/.local/bin/pokemon && cp pokemon ~/.local/bin`
